# Chomp Clone
This is a website recreation attempt for [Chomp Template](https://chomp.webflow.io/) from webflow. The goal is to create a functional front-end + back-end app.

Current goal is only on the visual layout of the front page. The focus is on the mobile layout first. The laptop/desktop version will eventually be completed as well.

## Current Status
Majority of the structure and CSS layout completed for mobile, laptop, and desktop views. Majority of JavaScript completed. Main features completed for a standalone front-end web app. 

## Next goals would be the following:
- Animations
- Additional Pages
- Back-end implementation
