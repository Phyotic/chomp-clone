# **Chomp Clone**

This repository is my recreation of the [Chomp Template](https://chomp.webflow.io/) from webflow. The goal is to replicate the functional front-end and add some simple back-end functionality.

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate functional front-end and simple back-end capbailities. 

# **Features**

* **Front-end Development**: The website has been recreated to mirror the [Chomp Template](https://chomp.webflow.io/) design, experience, and UI. The technologies I used are HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

* **Back-end Development**: As the original template does not have any back-end development, I will simply create a few endpoints to retrieve and send back template files. The purpose is to show basic a basic back-end connection. This will be accomplished using Java and the Spring Boot framework.

* **Responsive**: I've recreated the website using mobile-first design but ensured responsiveness for larger screens using media queries and scalable implementations.
